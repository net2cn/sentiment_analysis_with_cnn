# sentiment_analysis_with_cnn
An implementation aims to solve Kaggle's [challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/sentiment-analysis-on-movie-reviews)

Also, this is my submission of FudanNLP's [nlp-beginner](https://github.com/FudanNLP/nlp-beginner) task 2.

Download your dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/sentiment-analysis-on-movie-reviews/data).

---

## Usage
Create a folder named "datasets" in the root folder and place "train.tsv" and "test.tsv" under it. Then run
```
python main.py
```

You should be able to see the output in the shell. You'll also have a "submission.csv" placed under the root folder after the execution.
